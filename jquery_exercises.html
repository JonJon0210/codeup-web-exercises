<p id="paragraph1">I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus. Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye! My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard! Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine?
    Must go faster. Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus. We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore!
    Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates donâ€™t eat the tourists. Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should. God help us, we're in the hands of engineers.
    Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine? Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking.
    Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore! Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist?</p>
